7. **What happens when the condition inside the if and while evaluate to false?**
   - A) Python interpreter ignores the if/while blocks, and halts the program.
   - B) Python interpreter ignores the if/while blocks, and proceeds the program from the lines after the if/while block.
   - C) Python interpreter executes the if/while blocks, and rest of the program.
   - D) Python interpreter executes the if/while, and the programs runs in an infinite loop.
