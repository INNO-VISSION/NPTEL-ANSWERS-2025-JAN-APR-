#### Questions:

##### 1. If n is a positive integer, what is the output of the function given input n?
- (A) Sum of numbers from 1 to n
- (B) Sum of numbers from 1 to n-1
- (C) n-1
- (D) n

**Answer:** (A)

##### 2. Assertion (A): If a recursive function doesn’t have a base case, it may never stop.
Reason (R): Recursion means that a function calls itself.
- (A) Both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).
- (B) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
- (C) (A) is true, but (R) is false.
- (D) (A) is false, but (R) is true.

**Answer:** (B)

##### 3. What is the output of the following code?
- (A) Error
- (B) 25
- (C) 26
- (D) 5

**Answer:** (C)

##### 4. In English, the letter ‘z’ usually appears far less often than most letters. Now imagine applying a Substitution Cipher to a large body of English text, where ‘z’ is replaced by ‘r’, and every other letter is also mapped to a unique letter. After encryption, which letter is likely to be the least frequent in the new text?
- (A) z
- (B) r
- (C) e
- (D) It is not possible to determine

**Answer:** (B)

##### 5. If you have a large ciphertext produced by a simple substitution cipher on an English text, can you determine the original message by examining how often each letter appears?
- (A) Yes, it can be done.
- (B) No, it cannot be done.

**Answer:** (A)

##### 6. Suppose you suspect that a piece of ciphertext was produced using a simple substitution cipher. Under which circumstances might frequency analysis fail to yield accurate results?
- (A) The ciphertext is short.
- (B) The ciphertext was encrypted with another method before encrypting with substitution cipher.
- (C) The ciphertext is very long.

**Answer:** (A),(B)

##### 7. If variable dict_name is a non-empty dictionary, what does dict_name.values() return?
- (A) Returns nothing, but prints all the keys in the dictionary.
- (B) Returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
- (C) Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.
- (D) Returns a list of all the items in the dictionary.

**Answer:** (C)

##### 8. Assertion (A): A Caesar Cipher is a type of Substitution Cipher.
Reason (R): In a Caesar Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter at a fixed shift in the alphabet.
- (A) Both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).
- (B) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).
- (C) (A) is true, but (R) is false.
- (D) (A) is false, but (R) is true.

**Answer:** (A)

##### 9. Which outcome generally follows from providing a proper base case in a recursive function?
- (A) The function returns a predefined result when the base condition is met.
- (B) It prevents infinite recursion and stops when a specific condition is met.
- (C) It ensures recursion depth is always constant.
- (D) It allows the function to keep calling itself indefinitely.

**Answer:** (A),(B)

##### 10. In a standard 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe board, how many distinct winning lines (rows, columns, or diagonals) pass through the center square?
- (A) 3
- (B) 2
- (C) 5
- (D) 4

**Answer:** (D)
