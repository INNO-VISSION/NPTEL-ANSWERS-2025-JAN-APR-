### **2. What is the key difference between lists and tuples in Python, and when would you choose one over the other?**  

a) Lists are immutable and can be used when elements need to be modified, while tuples are mutable and best for storing fixed data.  
b) Lists are mutable and can be used for dynamic data manipulation, while tuples are immutable and used to store fixed collections of items.  
c) Both lists and tuples are mutable and can be used interchangeably for any purpose.  
d) Tuples are used only for string data, while lists can store any data type.
