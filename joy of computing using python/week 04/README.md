---

##### **8. For what \( n_1, n_2 \) will the variable flag inside mystery2() be equal to True?**
   
   a. 1,2  
   b. 2,3  
   c. 3,4  
   d. 0,0  
   
   **Answer:** b. 2,3  

---

##### **9. If all possible pairs of prime numbers between 0 and 10 are given to \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \), for how many pairs would mystery2() print "Completed"?**
   
   a. It will print "Completed" only for pairs (2,3), (7,2), (2,5), and for the remaining it would not print "Completed".  
   b. It will print "Completed" only for pair (2,3), and for the remaining other pairs of primes it would not print "Completed".  
   c. It will print "Completed" for all pairs of primes between 0 and 20.  
   d. It will not print "Completed" for any pair.  
   
   **Answer:** a. It will print "Completed" only for pairs (2,3), (7,2), (2,5), and for the remaining it would not print "Completed".  

---

##### **10. If the number of pairs of primes that result in mystery2() printing "Completed" is fewer than 1, can we edit the code in mystery2() so that "Completed" is always printed for any pair of primes?**
   
   a. Yes, we can change the logic for setting the flag variable to False.  
   b. No, it is logically not possible.  
   c. Yes, we can change/decrease the threshold for the length of list2 in the last if block.  
   d. Yes, we can change the initial value of flag to False instead of True.  
   
   **Answer:** c. Yes, we can change/decrease the threshold for the length of list2 in the last if block.
