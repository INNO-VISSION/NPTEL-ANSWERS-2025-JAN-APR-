---

##### 8. If P(M) = 0.5, P(N) = 0.8, P(N|M) = 0.50, Find P(M ∪ N): 
   - A. 0  
   - B. 0.1  
   - C. 2  
   - D. 1.05  
   Answer: D. 1.05  
   Explanation: Using the formula \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \).

##### 9. As per the central limit theorem, if n is substantially large, every distribution is close to:
   - A. binomial 
   - B. poison 
   - C. hyper Geometric distribution  
   - D. None
   Answer: D. None  
   Explanation: The central limit theorem states that, with a large sample size, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution.

##### 10. In probability theory, the value is always:
   - A. negative 
   - B. Negative and positive
   - C. Zero  
   - D. None 
   Answer: C. Zero 
   Explanation: Probabilities cannot be negative or greater than 1.
