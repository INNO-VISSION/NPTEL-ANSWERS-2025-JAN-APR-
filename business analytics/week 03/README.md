#### Week 03 : Business Analytics For Management Decision

1. Value of probability is between:
   - A. 0 and 4  
   - B. -1 and 1  
   - C. -1 and 0  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* D. None  
   *Explanation:* Probability values range from 0 to 1. None of the given options are correct.

2. Which one is odd?
   - A. MAD  
   - B. MAPE  
   - C. MSE  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* B. MAPE  
   *Explanation:* MAD and MSE are error metrics based on absolute and squared errors, while MAPE measures percentage errors, making it different.

3. In inferential analytics, we consider:
   - A. at 10%  
   - B. at 5%  
   - C. at 1%  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* B. at 5%  
   *Explanation:* A 5% level of significance is standard in hypothesis testing for making decisions.

4. The mode of this series (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10) is _______.
   - A. 10  
   - B. 0  
   - C. 1  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* A. 10  
   *Explanation:* Mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Here, 10 occurs most often.

5. Which is not part of the probability theory?
   - A. Marginal probability  
   - B. Conditional probability  
   - C. Joint probability  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* D. None  
   *Explanation:* All the listed options are components of probability theory.

   - A. Zero variance
   - B. Constant variance  
   - C. Negative variance  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* B. Constant variance
   *Explanation:* The plot shows points with consistent spread around the line, indicating constant variance.

7. The below figures reflect:

   - A. Contingency table  
   - B. Reflecting a sum of investment  
   - C. X and Y are uniform  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* A. Contingency table  
   *Explanation:* A contingency table organizes data into rows and columns to show the frequency distribution of variables.

8. The sum of probability is __________.
   - A. 1.0  
   - B. 10.0  
   - C. 0.01  
   - D. 100  
   *Answer:* A. 1.0  
   *Explanation:* The total probability of all possible outcomes in an experiment equals 1.0.

9. If X and Y are independent, then P(X and Y) ________.
   - A. Positive  
   - B. Zero  
   - C. Negative  
   - D. None  
   *Answer:* A. Positive  
   *Explanation:* For independent events, P(X and Y) = P(X) * P(Y), which is always positive if both probabilities are positive.

10. The value of joint probability:
    - A. Positive  
    - B. Negative  
    - C. Between 10 and 100  
    - D. Between 0 and 5  
    *Answer:* C. Between 10 and 100  
    *Explanation:* The range depends on the context of probabilities but generally lies within 0 to 1 or scaled appropriately.

11. Which player is consistent?
 
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fffde0c5-ec2c-4c56-93e3-5068e47527e8)

    - A. Both are consistent  
    - B. Cannot be determined  
    - C. Requires additional information  
    - D. None  
    *Answer:* A. Both are consistent  
    *Explanation:* Consistency depends on variance, and if both have similar variances, both are consistent.

12. Below figure depicts the following
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e9f38a2-2dd0-4c31-96d7-22e3e9ba624a)

    - A. Uniform distribution  
    - B. Range is zero  
    - C. Negative variance  
    - D. None  
    *Answer:* D. None  
    *Explanation:* The figure does not match the descriptions provided in the options.

13. The sum of two probabilities (A and B) is:
    - A. Greater than 1  
    - B. Negative  
    - C. Between 0 and 1  
    - D. Equal to 0  
    *Answer:* C. Between 0 and 1  
    *Explanation:* The sum of two valid probabilities is between 0 and 1 if they represent non-overlapping events.

14. Given P(X) = 0.40, P(Y) = 0.50, P(X∩Y) = 1.15. Find P(X∣Y):  
    - A. 0.25  
    - B. 0.75  
    - C. 0.12  
    - D. None  
    *Answer:* D. None  
    *Explanation:* The value of P(X∩Y) exceeds 1, which is invalid, making the calculation impossible.

15. Which one is continuous distribution:
    - A. Poisson  
    - B. Binomial  
    - C. Uniform  
    - D. None  
    *Answer:* C. Uniform  
    *Explanation:* Uniform distribution is a continuous distribution where all intervals of the same length are equally probable.
