##### **1. The exponential distribution is _______.**  
A. bimodal

B. symmetric

C. skewed to the left

D. None

**Answer:** D. None

**Explanation:**  

The exponential distribution is skewed to the right, not to the left or symmetric! .

##### **2. The standard normal distribution is also called _______.**  

A. a discrete distribution  
B. a finite distribution  
C. an exponential distribution  
D. None  

**Answer:** D. None  

**Explanation:**  

The standard normal distribution is also called the **z-distribution**, which is a **continuous probability distribution** with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  

---

##### **3. The z value associated with a two-sided 90% confidence interval is _______.**  

A. 1.111  
B. 1.645  
C. 1.561  
D. 2.551  

**Answer:** B. 1.645  

**Explanation:**  

For a **90% confidence interval**, the critical z-value is **1.645** in a **two-tailed test**. This means 5% of the distribution lies in each tail (totaling 10%).  

---

##### **4. The t-distribution is similar to a normal distribution. However, the t-distribution is _______.**  

A. symmetric  
B. bimodal  
C. flatter  
D. discrete  

**Answer:** A. symmetric  

**Explanation:**  


The **t-distribution** is:  
- **Symmetric** around the mean, like the normal distribution.  
- **Flatter and wider** than the normal distribution, especially with smaller sample sizes.  
- As the **sample size increases**, the t-distribution **approaches the normal distribution**.  

---

##### **5. The table t value associated with 8 degrees of freedom and used to compute a 99% confidence interval is _______.**  

A. 1.397  
B. 1.860  
C. 3.355  
D. 2.896  

**Answer:** C. 3.355  

**Explanation:**  


For a **99% confidence interval** with **8 degrees of freedom**, the critical **t-value** from the t-distribution table is **3.355**.  

---

##### **6. The normal distribution is also referred to as _______.**  

A. the Poisson distribution  
B. the de Moivre distribution  
C. the exponential distribution  
D. the Gaussian distribution  

**Answer:** D. the Gaussian distribution  

**Explanation:**  


The **normal distribution** is commonly called the **Gaussian distribution**, named after the mathematician **Carl Friedrich Gauss**.   

---

##### **7. The finite correction factor should be used if the sample size is _______.**  

A. less than 5% of the population size  
B. more than 5% of the population size  
C. less than 30  
D. more than 100  

**Answer:** B. more than 5% of the population size  

**Explanation:**  


The **finite population correction (FPC)** factor is applied when the sample size is **more than 5% of the population size** (i.e., \( n/N > 0.05 \)). This adjustment corrects for the reduced variability when sampling without replacement from a small population.   

---

##### **8. In finding a confidence interval for the population mean, the population standard deviation should be used if it is known. If the population standard deviation is not known, then it should be estimated with _______.** 

A. the sample variance  
B. the sample standard deviation  
C. the range  
D. the mean  

**Answer:** B. the sample standard deviation  

**Explanation:**  


The sample standard deviation is used to estimate the population standard deviation when it is unknown!

##### **9. For an exponential distribution with lambda (Œª) equal to 4 per minute, the mean (Œº) is __________.**  

A. 40  
B. 0.25  
C. 15  
D. 13  

**Answer:** B. 0.25  

**Explanation:**  

The mean of an exponential distribution is given by the formula:



ùúá =
1/
ùúÜ
‚Äã
 
Substitute Œª = 4:

ùúá=1/4 =
0.25

##### **10. The table t value associated with 12 degrees of freedom and used to compute a 95% confidence interval is _______.**  

A. 2.55  
B. 2.179  
C. 1.382  
D. 1.396  

**Answer:** B. 2.179  

**Explanation:**  

For a 95% confidence interval with 12 degrees of freedom, the critical t value from the t-distribution table is approximately 2.179.

##### **11. Using the below ANOVA table, find out F calculated  

| **Source of Variation** | **SS** | **df** | **MS** | **F** |
|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Treatment**           | 12     | 5      |        |       |
| **Error**               | 8      | 8      |        |       |
| **Total**               |        |        |        |       |

**Options:**  
- A. 200  
- B. 220  
- C. 230  
- D. None  

---

##### **12. With the sample of 22, 35, 32, and 21, the critical chi-square value at Œ± = 0.05 is _______.**  

A. 12.3  
B. 13.3  
C. 14.3  
D. None  

**Answer: B. 13.3** 

**Explanation:**  

Since there are 4 values, the degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.  
From the chi-square distribution table at df = 3 and Œ± = 0.05, the critical value is **7.815**, so the given options don‚Äôt match. The correct choice would be **D. None**, but if this is a matching question, you might want to verify the options.  

---

##### **13. With the sample of 22, 35, 32, and 21, the calculated chi-square value is _______.**

A. 32  
B. 35  
C. 36  
D. None  

**Answer: D. None**  

**Explanation:**  

The calculated chi-square value is approximately **5.42**, which doesn‚Äôt match the given options!  

---

##### **14. In the below ANOVA table, the value of TSS is:**  

| Source of Variation | SS | df | MS | F |
|---------------------|----|----|----|---|
| Treatment           | 35 |  2 |    |   |
| Error               | 72 |  6 |    |   |
| Total               |    |    |    |   |

A. 78  
B. 68  
C. 47  
D. None  

**Correct Answer: D. None**  

**Explanation:**  

The Total Sum of Squares (TSS) is the sum of the treatment sum of squares (SS) and the error sum of squares (SS).  

TSS = SS treatment + SS error = 35 + 72 = 107

Since 107 is not an option, the correct choice is **D. None**.  

---

##### **15. With this below ANOVA table, the typical null hypothesis is:**  

| Source of Variation | SS | df | MS | F |
|---------------------|----|----|----|---|
| Between Groups      | 34 |  2 |    |   |
| Within Groups       | 12 |  5 |    |   |
| Total               | 46 |  7 |    |   |

A. reject the null hypothesis ùúá1m‚â§ ùúá2 ‚â§ ùúá3
‚Äã
  
B. do not reject the null hypothesis ùúá1 ‚â† ùúá2
‚Äã
C. reject the null hypothesis ùúá1 ‚â• ùúá2 ‚â•ùúá3

D. None  

**Answer: D. None**  

**Explanation:**  

In ANOVA, the typical null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ) states that all group means are equal:  

H0 : Œº1 =Œº2 =Œº3
‚Äã

The alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ) suggests at least one mean is different.  
None of the options listed correctly state the standard null hypothesis for ANOVA, so the correct answer is **D. None**.
