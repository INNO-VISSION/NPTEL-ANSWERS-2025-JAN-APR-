#### 8. What is the difference between piezoelectric and piezoresistive sensors?


a. There is no difference; both are different names of the same phenomenon.

b. Piezoelectric sensors are easier to interface with data acquisition systems than piezoresistive sensors.

c. Piezoelectric sensors accumulate charge in response to mechanical force, while piezoresistive sensors cause a change in resistance in response to mechanical force.

**Answer:** c. Piezoelectric sensors accumulate charge in response to mechanical force, while piezoresistive sensors cause a change in resistance in response to mechanical force.
