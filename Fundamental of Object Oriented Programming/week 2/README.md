   void createObject() {
   
       Sample obj;
       std::cout << "Inside createObject function\n";
   }
   
   int main() {
   
       std::cout << "Before calling createObject\n";

         After calling createObject  
   - d. Inside createObject function  
         Constructor called  
         After calling createObject  
   *Answer*: c. Before calling createObject  
                  Constructor called  
                  Inside createObject function

8. *A class in C++ has multiple constructors. How does the compiler decide which constructor to use?*  
   Options:
