3. If a class is considered a "set" in mathematical terms, which of the following could be considered as objects?  
     a. Functions defined on the set  
     b. Elements of the set  
     c. Subsets of the set

4. Encapsulation can be mathematically represented as:  
     a. \( f: X \to Y \), where \( X \) and \( Y \) represent private and public data, respectively.  
     b. \( f: A \to A \), where \( f \) is identity over the class.  
     c. \( f: X \to Y \), implying data and methods are the same.  
     d. \( f: X \to X \), where \( f \) is a structure-preserving map over private data.  
   Answer: d. \( f: X \to X \), where \( f \) is a structure-preserving map over private data.

5. Which of the following best describes polymorphism in a mathematical sense?  

     a. Multiple functions \( f_1: A \to B, f_2: C \to D \), etc., with the same name but possibly independent input-output types.  
     b. A single function \( f \) defined as \( f: A \to B \) and \( f: C \to D \), operating across different domains and codomains.  
     c. A function \( f: A \to A \), that maps elements within the same domain and codomain.  
     d. A composite function \( f \circ g: X \to Y \), where \( g: X \to Z \) and \( f: Z \to Y \), used to chain operations.  
   Answer: a. Multiple functions \( f_1: A \to B, f_2: C \to D \), etc., with the same name but possibly independent input-output types.

6. Inheritance in OOP is most analogous to:  

     a. Set theory: Subsets inheriting properties of supersets.  
     b. Group theory: Groups inheriting properties of subgroups.  
     c. Graph theory: Nodes inheriting edges.  
     d. Linear algebra: Matrices inheriting vector spaces.  
   Answer: a. Set theory: Subsets inheriting properties of supersets.

7. Which of the following best encapsulates the core purpose of object-oriented programming?  

     a. Maximizing code reuse and scalability.  
     b. Simplifying logical flow in functional applications.  
     c. Optimizing mathematical operations on datasets.  
     d. Ensuring type safety at runtime.  
     Answer: a. Maximizing code reuse and scalability.

8. In an object-oriented system, relationships between objects are best modeled as:  
     a. Directed graphs  
     b. Bipartite graphs  
     c. Sets with cardinality constraints  
     d. Undirected graphs  
   Answer: a. Directed graphs
---
9. Which of the following best explains the idea of abstraction in OOP?  

     a. Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the relevant features.  
     b. A mapping between two completely unrelated concepts.  
     c. Defining all possible implementations explicitly in a class.  
     d. Combining unrelated objects into a single type.  
  Answer: a. Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the relevant features.
---
10. Polymorphism in OOP is analogous to which of the following concepts?  
      a. A function that behaves differently depending on the input.  
      b. Using the same name for multiple variables in a program.  
      c. A method that only works with one specific type of data.  
      d. Changing the internal logic of a program without altering its behavior.  
     Answer: a. A function that behaves differently depending on the input.
